# Technical Specification: AI Image Generation GUI

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical specifications for the AI Image Generation GUI application. The system provides a user-friendly interface for generating images using AI models.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:
- **Frontend**: Electron + React (or vanilla JS) desktop GUI for user interactions
- **Backend**: Node.js service for API, prompt optimization, and file operations
- **AI Connector**: Integrates with OpenAI Chat API (for prompt optimization) and Image API (for image generation)
- **Storage**: Filesystem-based JSON and asset management

## 3. Features and Requirements

### 3.1 Core Features
- Project, campaign, and request management (JSON-based)
- Prompt optimization using project/campaign context and approved references
- Reference library with pin/unpin for style consistency
- Feedback loop for iterative improvement
- Local asset and log management (structured folders)
- Results gallery and approval workflow

### 3.2 Technical Requirements
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Local API connection to AI models
- Image format support (PNG, JPEG)

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Frontend
- Sidebar navigation: Project → Campaign → Request
- Main pane: request details, context display, prompt editor, Generate button, approved examples panel, results gallery
- **Option 1: React-based approach**
  - **Framework**: React with TypeScript
  - **State Management**: Redux
  - **UI Library**: Material-UI
  - **Build Tool**: Vite
  - **Note**: Requires development server and build process

**Option 2: Simplified approach**
- **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
- **Enhancement Libraries**: Alpine.js or similar lightweight framework
- **Styling**: Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS
- **Advantage**: Can be run directly in browser without build steps

### 4.2 Backend
- Node.js service for API endpoints, prompt optimization, and file I/O
- Uses OpenAI's `openai` NPM package for Chat and Image APIs
- **Language**: Node.js/Python
- **API**: REST endpoints for image generation
- **Authentication**: API key-based access to AI models

### 4.3 AI Connector
- Prompt optimizer: builds improved prompt from project style guide, campaign parameters, pinned references, and raw prompt (+ feedback)
- Image generator: calls OpenAI Image API with improved prompt
- Feedback loop: on rejection, feedback is appended and prompt is re-optimized

## 5. Data Flow & Workflow
1. User creates/selects project and campaign
2. User creates a request with a raw prompt
3. System builds context (project, campaign, pinned references)
4. Prompt optimizer (Chat API) improves the prompt
5. Image API generates image(s)
6. Images displayed in gallery; user can approve/reject
7. Approved images are saved as references; rejected images trigger feedback loop
8. All actions are logged in structured JSON files

## 6. User Interface Design

### 6.1 Main Components
- Sidebar: project/campaign/request navigation
- Main pane: context display, prompt editor, Generate button, approved examples panel, results gallery

### 6.2 Workflow
- User enters or selects a prompt
- Adjusts generation parameters as needed
- Initiates generation process
- Views, saves, or modifies the resulting image
- Approves/rejects and provides feedback

## 7. Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality
- Core UI implementation
- Basic prompt-to-image generation
- Essential settings controls

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- History management
- Preset templates
- Advanced parameter controls

### Phase 3: Optimization
- Performance improvements
- UI/UX refinements
- Additional export options

## 8. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core components
- Integration tests for API communication
- User acceptance testing for UI workflows

## 9. Deployment
- Electron packaging for desktop deployment
- CI/CD pipeline for automated builds
- Update mechanism for software and model updates

## 10. Dependencies
- Node.js runtime
- Python environment for AI models
- GPU support for optimal performance (CUDA/DirectML)
- Storage for image history and presets
