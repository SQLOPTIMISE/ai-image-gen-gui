# Remediation Plan: AI Image Generation GUI

## Purpose
This document outlines a detailed remediation and enhancement plan for the AI Image Generation GUI, based on the current state of the codebase and the updated requirements and documentation.

---

## 1. Summary of Current State
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express REST API, file-based storage, OpenAI integration, schema validation.
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS SPA with Bootstrap, implements main workflow and UI components.
- **Utilities:** Model check and debug scripts present.
- **Documentation:** Updated to reflect intended architecture and workflow.

## 2. Gap Analysis & Remediation Tasks

### A. UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Add user feedback for errors and loading states throughout the UI.
- [ ] Display the optimized prompt to the user after prompt optimization and before image generation, so users can see what is being sent to the AI model.
- [ ] Show a progress bar or animation while the image is being generated, to indicate ongoing processing.
- [ ] Improve gallery and reference management UI (thumbnails, pin/unpin, etc.).
- [ ] Add tooltips/help text for new users.
- [ ] Enhance accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).

### B. Error Handling & Validation
- [ ] Ensure all API errors are surfaced to the frontend with clear, actionable messages.
- [ ] Add validation for all user inputs (project, campaign, request forms).
- [ ] Add backend validation for all endpoints.

### C. Testing
- [ ] Add backend unit and integration tests (Jest or Mocha).
- [ ] Add frontend tests (Cypress or similar, if feasible).
- [ ] Add test data and example JSON files for projects, campaigns, and requests.

### D. Documentation
- [ ] Add example project/campaign/request JSON files.
- [ ] Add UI screenshots or diagrams to README/overview.
- [ ] Document error cases and troubleshooting steps in more detail.
- [ ] Clarify in all documentation that both projects and campaigns can have their own reference images, and that campaign references are in addition to those inherited from the project.
- [ ] Document the new UI features: optimized prompt display and progress animation during image generation.

### E. Performance & Security
- [ ] Add caching for project/campaign/request lists if needed.
- [ ] Consider basic authentication for API endpoints (if multi-user or networked).
- [ ] Review and optimize file I/O for large projects.

### F. Optional: React/Electron Migration
- [ ] Plan and begin migration of frontend to React for maintainability and scalability.
- [ ] Wrap the app with Electron for desktop packaging.
- [ ] Modularize UI components.

### G. v2 Roadmap (Future)
- [ ] Plan for region-based annotation and in-image masking.
- [ ] Plan for SQL/Cloud storage, multi-user support, and deployment.

## 3. Recommended Order of Work
1. UI/UX improvements and error handling
2. Add optimized prompt display and progress animation to the UI
3. Add automated tests (backend, then frontend)
4. Enhance documentation with examples and visuals
5. (Optional) Begin React/Electron migration
6. (Optional) Add performance/security improvements
7. Prepare v2 roadmap and technical spikes for advanced features

---

## 4. Next Steps
- Review and adjust priorities as needed.
- Assign tasks and track progress.
- Schedule regular reviews to update this plan and documentation.

*This plan is intended for review and execution by the Claude code model agent or other development team members.*
